#### Sbqs are nothing but sql queries nested within another queries(which we call as "Outer query or Main query").
#### Sbqs must always be enclosed within parenthesis().

Practicing SQL Subqueries (from Basic to Advanced)
________________________________________
# Level 1: Basic Subqueries in SELECT and WHERE Clauses
## ðŸ§  Concepts:
â€¢	Scalar subqueries
â€¢	Simple filtering with IN, =, >, etc.
## ðŸ›  Practice Ideas:
1.	Subquery in WHERE clause to filter results
2.	Subquery in SELECT clause to return a single value
3.	Use IN, NOT IN, =, != with subqueries
## ðŸ§ª Example Exercises:
â€¢	Find books priced above the average book price
â€¢	List customers who placed an order (WHERE customer_id IN (...))
â€¢	Get the most expensive book using MAX(...) in a subquery

# Level 2: Subqueries in FROM Clause (Derived Tables)
## ðŸ§  Concepts:
â€¢	Using subqueries as inline views or temporary tables
â€¢	Aggregating before joining
## ðŸ›  Practice Ideas:
1.	Subquery to get total orders per customer, then join to get names
2.	Subquery to get max price per author, then join with books
## ðŸ§ª Example Exercises:
â€¢	Show customers with total orders greater than $50
â€¢	Get book titles with price greater than their authorâ€™s average book price
## ðŸ’¡ Tip:
â€¢	Give subqueries aliases (AS temp) and treat them like real tables

# Level 3: Correlated Subqueries
## ðŸ§  Concepts:
â€¢	Subquery that refers to outer queryâ€™s row
â€¢	Executes once per row in outer query
## ðŸ›  Practice Ideas:
1.	Find each customerâ€™s most recent order
2.	Find customers who ordered more books than average customer
## ðŸ§ª Example Exercises:
â€¢	List books that are more expensive than any other book by same author
â€¢	Show each customer and their highest total order amount
## âš  Caution:
â€¢	These are slower than normal subqueries; practice optimizing them later

# Level 4: Subqueries with EXISTS, NOT EXISTS
## ðŸ§  Concepts:
â€¢	Use for existence checks
â€¢	Efficient for anti-joins (e.g. customers who haven't ordered)
## ðŸ›  Practice Ideas:
1.	Customers who have placed orders
2.	Customers who havenâ€™t ordered a specific book
## ðŸ§ª Example Exercises:
â€¢	Show books that have not been ordered
â€¢	Find customers who ordered every book by an author

# Level 5: Nested Subqueries and Multi-level Logic
## ðŸ§  Concepts:
â€¢	Combining multiple subquery types (e.g., scalar inside correlated)
â€¢	Building reports from complex data relationships
## ðŸ›  Practice Ideas:
1.	Customers who spent more than any customer from a specific country
2.	Orders where total is above customer's average order
## ðŸ§ª Example Exercises:
â€¢	Customers who ordered more books than any other customer
â€¢	Find books ordered by all customers from USA
