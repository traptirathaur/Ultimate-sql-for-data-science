### A Common Table Expression(CTE) is a named(a unique name for the CTE expression) temporary table, derived from a query. 
### They start with clause "With".
### Above I have used term "temporary" means CTEs exist only for the duration of the query in which they are defined and are not stored permanently in the databse.

## Note-
### A CTE can be referred multiple times within the same main query to avoid redundant queries. <!--and improving maintainability.-->
### CTEs can be self-referencing, allowing recursive operations to handle hierarchical or graph-like data structures.
